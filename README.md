# 3DUnetCNN
 Keras 3D U-Net Convolution Neural Network (CNN) designed for medical image segmentation
Background

Originally designed after [this paper](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2016/CABR16/cicek16miccai.pdf) on volumetric segmentation with a 3D U-Net. 
The code was written to be trained using the BRATS data set for brain tumors, 
but it can be easily modified to be used in other 3D applications.
